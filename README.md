# Pig-Game-App
Just a silly counting game. Still in production! 

## Rules

Get to the 100 first and win! 

- Each player rolls dice and stores total rolled points in the current box;
- In case of rolling 1 player loses all current points and passes the turn;
- Player can hold their current points and transfer them to the total and end their turn.

First player to reach 100 points wins!

All numbers 1-6 are equally probable even tho it feels like 1 appears way too much!
